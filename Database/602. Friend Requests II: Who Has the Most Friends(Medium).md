# 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends
[https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends/description/)

## Key
* 把(requester, accepter)和 (accepter, requester）合并成一张表，group by第一列然后统计第二列的个数，最后order by 第二列并且取descending的第一行
* 看discuss里说应该把union all改成union，因为union可以remove duplicate

## Code
```
select id1 as id, count(id2) as num
from
(select requester_id as id1, accepter_id as id2 from request_accepted
 union all
 select accepter_id as id1, requester_id as id2  from request_accepted) 
 tmp1
 group by id1 
 
 order by num desc limit 1
 ```
