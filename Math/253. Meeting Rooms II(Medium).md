# 253. Meeting Rooms II
## Key
* "firstEnd" records the first end time in the current using meeting rooms

* search through the meetings by the increasing start time:

1. If the start time is smaller than the first end time in the current using meeting rooms,
then it means we need to add a new room. Because there's no room can be used.

2. If the start time is larger, then it means we can add this meeting to the room after the meeting with the first end time. 
And the first end time in the current meeting rooms will become the next larger end time.

## Code
```
class Solution {    
	public int minMeetingRooms(Interval[] intervals) {
		int[] start = new int[intervals.length];
        int[] end = new int[intervals.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++){
            start[i] = intervals[i].start;
            end[i] = intervals[i].end;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(start);
        Arrays.sort(end);
        
        int total = 0;
        int firstEnd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < start.length; i++){
            if (start[i] < end[firstEnd]) total++;
            else firstEnd++;
        }
        
        return total;
        
	}
}
```
