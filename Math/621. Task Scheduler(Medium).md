## Key
 * A,A,A,B,B,B,C,C,D,D,D  N=3
 
   A, B, D ,SPACE,    A, B, D, SPACE,     A, B, D
 
   A, B, D, C,        A, B, D, C,         A, B, D   
             
 * Suppose the most requent numbers' frequency is f0, the number of the most frequent numbers is n0 
 
 * Then we "at least" need to create (f0-1)*(n+1)+n0 intervals to satisfy the requirements for the most frequency numbers
 
 * The intervals consists of f0 groups with the length of n+1 in each group(except the last one)
 
 * And then, we insert the most frequent numbers in the remaining numbers into the spaces and so on. We can always make sure that the numbers inserted satisfy the requirements.
 
 * In this process, if the spaces are enough, then the remaining spaces will become "idle"s.
 * In this process, if the spaces are not enough, then simply insert following each of the spaces. We can also make sure that the numbers inserted satisfy the requirements. In this situation, the number of intervals will be the number of all the original numbers, since there are not any idles between the numbers.
           
 * All in all, we need at least (f0-1) * (n+1) +n0 and if the spaces are enough. If the spaces are not enough, then we can still insert numbers without using new spaces and the answer will be the number of all the original numbers.
 
 # Code
 ```
 class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] num = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++){
            num[tasks[i]-'A']++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(num);
        
        int i = 25;
        while (i>=0 && num[i] == num[25]) i--;
        
        return Math.max(tasks.length, (num[25]-1)*(n+1)+(25-i));
    }
}
 ```
