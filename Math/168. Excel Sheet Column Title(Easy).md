# 168. Excel Sheet Column Title
[https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/discuss/](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/discuss/)
## Key
* The range of each digit is 1...26 which instead using the solution of translating to base 26 each digit should be 0..25
So we need to find a way to still use the solution but transfer into 1...26 representing A...Z

* Suppose the integer we look now is n = 26 * x + r 
and r is 1...26(A...Z) which represents the last char in excel column

however using the solution of %26, we get 0...25
so:
(n-1) % 26 = r-1
(n-1) % 26 +1 = r

everytime before we %26 and /26, we let n = n-1

## Code
```
class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int n) {
        String ans = "";

        while (n>0){
            n = n-1;
            
            int x = n % 26;           
            String add = Character.toString((char)('A'+x));
            ans = add + ans;
            n = n/26;
        } 
        return ans;
    }
}
```
