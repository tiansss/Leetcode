# 278. First Bad Version

[https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/)
## Key
* Binary search
* Can not use mid = (left + right)/2 because (left + right) will overflow. 

* An alternative way to compute mid: mid = left + (right - left)/2

## Code
```
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while (left < right){
            // int mid = (left+right)/2; left + right  will overflow!!
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
