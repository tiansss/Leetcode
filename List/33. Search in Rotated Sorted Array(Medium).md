# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Key
* first use modified binary search to find the smallest number and record as the rotation
* use the normal binary search but need to find the real mid in the current array

## Code
```
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left<right){
            int mid = (left+right)/2;
            if (nums[mid]<nums[right]) right = mid; //not "right = mid - 1" because need to judge "mid"
            else left = mid + 1;            
        }
        
        int rotate = left; 
        //if we need to find x in the original position mid, then x is in the position  ?  right now
        //  ? = (mid + rotate) % nums.length

        left = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left<=right){ //don't forget to add "=" because need to judge the last one
            int mid = (left + right)/2;
            int realmid = (mid + rotate) % nums.length;
            
            if (nums[realmid] == target) return realmid;
            if (nums[realmid] < target) left = mid +1;
            else right = mid - 1; //don't need to judge mid because mid was judged first
        }
        return -1;       
    }
}
```
