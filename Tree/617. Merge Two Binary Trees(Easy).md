# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees
[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/description/)

First, think of the procedure of solving the main task, and then consider the edges.

For this problem, the main task is to add. So write the add line first, and then assign the problem to be solved in the recursion of the left part and right part. Finally, consider the edge case.

```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if (t1==null) return t2;
        if (t2==null) return t1;
        TreeNode p=new TreeNode(t1.val+t2.val);
        p.left=mergeTrees(t1.left,t2.left);
        p.right=mergeTrees(t1.right,t2.right);
        return p;
    }
}
```
