# 388. Longest Absolute File Path(Medium)
[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/description/)
 
 A disgusting problem. I hate it!!!!!
  
 
 
 Main idea:
 
 1.split the string by \n . (The first string can be seen actually has a \n at the start. For example, the path:"dir\np1.txt",  dir and p1.txt is in the same path)
 
 2.caculate the \t in each string to record the level 
 
 3.move to the right position to push into the stack
 
 4.check if it's the file which means a string with ".", then caculate the total length and update the maxlen.
 ```
 int level = s.length() - s.replace("\t", "").length(); 
 ```
 
 Can be improved by not using the hashmap. Just store the length in stack and the size of stack is the level by now.
 
 ```
class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
       	String[] str = input.split("\n");  
        Stack <Integer> stack=new Stack<>();   //record the level
		Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();     //record the string length corresponding the related level
	
        stack.push(-1); //prevent stack empty exception
        int maxlen=0;  
		
        for (String s:str) {    //scan every string split by \n
			int level = s.length() - s.replace("\t", "").length();  //caculate the level
          
			 if (level>stack.peek()) {  //can directly push the level into stack
				stack.push(level);
				map.put(level, s.length()-level+1);  //need to remove the \t and add the backslash before the string
			 }
			 else {
				while (level<=stack.peek()){  //pop until find the position for this level
					map.put(stack.peek(),0);   //clear the corresponding length to 0
					stack.pop();
				}
			    stack.push(level);     
			    map.put(level,s.length()-level+1);
			}
            
            if (s.contains(".")) {  //find a file and add all lengths together
					int sum=0;
					for (int l:map.values()) {  
						sum+=l;            
					}
                    sum--; //the first string doesn't have the backslash
					maxlen=Math.max(maxlen, sum);
			}        		
		}		
		return maxlen;
    }
}
```
