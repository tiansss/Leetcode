# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)
* Using right pointer to scan from 0 to length of the string, once found the repeated character, move the left pointer to the position where the last repeated charater appears+1.
* Example: ABCBDEB, left = 0, right = 3. found repeated, left = 2(move to the next position of the first B), if found a B again in the future, move left to the second B + 1
* map(character, position of the last character appears)

## Code
```
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int l = 0; int max = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < s.length(); r++){
            if (map.containsKey(s.charAt(r)) && map.get(s.charAt(r)) >= l ) { 
                //If this char is repeated and the position of the last one is larget than left
                l = map.get(s.charAt(r))+1; //the left pointer moves to
            }
            else max = Math.max(max, r-l+1);
            
            map.put(s.charAt(r), r);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
